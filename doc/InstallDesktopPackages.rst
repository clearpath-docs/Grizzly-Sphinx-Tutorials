Install Desktop Packages
=========================  


.. note:: To install the software on your control computer, first ensure that you are using Ubuntu, and have `ROS Indigo <http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu>`_ installed.

If you'd like the simulation and visualization components, please also grab the desktop packages:

.. code:: bash

	sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-grizzly-desktop ros-indigo-grizzly-navigation ros-indigo-grizzly-simulator
